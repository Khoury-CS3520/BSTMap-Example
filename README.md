# BSTMap Example

- This is an incomplete example of building a generic map data structure from a templated binary search tree.
- Load the project into CLion and build.
  - Alternatively, build from the command line using cmake.  Do the following from within the cloned repo:
    - `mkdir build & cd build`
    - `cmake ..`
    - `cmake --build .`
